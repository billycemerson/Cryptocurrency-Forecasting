# Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting - Thesis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my thesis on **Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting**, where I compare different deep learning models, including:
- **Hybrid CNN-LSTM**
- **Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM**
- **Standard LSTM**
- **Standard BiLSTM**

The goal is to evaluate and determine the most effective approach for cryptocurrency price prediction.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
This project consists of two main components:

1. **Code**
   - Implements deep learning models for forecasting.
   - Utilizes **Rolling Window Cross-Validation** for better generalization.
   - Optimizes hyperparameters using **Optuna**.
   - Evaluates models based on accuracy metrics and performance.

2. **Presentation (Thesis Defense PPT)**
   - Summarizes research methodology, experiments, and findings.
   - Presents model comparison results.
   - Highlights contributions and key takeaways.

## ðŸš€ Technologies & Frameworks
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Deep Learning** (TensorFlow, Keras)
- **Optimization** (Optuna)
- **Rolling Window Cross-Validation** for robust forecasting
